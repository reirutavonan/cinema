## "Miracle"

The film with Julia Roberts and Owen Wilson cannot disappoint. The film tells the story of a boy named Augustus with a rare genetic disease that deprived the child of his face. Julia and Owen in the movie performed the role of parents who persistently went through all the difficulties, supporting their son. The story will help to see the best in people, to appreciate the loved ones next to each other even more, and maybe it will make you shed a tear.

## "First Wives Club"

If everything in your personal life is going wrong, then to give hope in a bright future is not worse than your psychologist (or maybe even better), will help comedy 90's "First Wives Club". The plot tells about three women after the breakup of the relationship, who decide to take revenge on their ex-lover, making them go through the same suffering. The women find an outlet in each other and create the "First Wives' Club" by making cunning revenge plans. Besides hundreds of ironic lines from the main characters, the film is full of motivating phrases and instructive life lessons. By the way, one of the roles in it was played by young Sarah Jessica Parker. We are sure that you have not seen her in this role yet.

## "For once in your life.

Painting with Kira Knightley, which may have passed you at one time. The calm mood of the film involves you in the viewing from the first minutes. It fully meets your expectations and leaves a pleasant precipitate. "For once in a lifetime" tells the story of record label manager Dan Mulligan, who lives in New York City and tries to stay in the industry. Soon he manages to find the author-composer Greta James (Keira Knightley). With her, he decides to record a music album in the streets of New York.

## "Letters to Juliette."

Adding a little romance to your life will never hurt. However, after this movie she will definitely come to you. And how else, if the story is inspired by the legendary play "Romeo and Juliet" by William Shakespeare. However, "Letters to Juliet" is not a remake of a familiar classic. All events take place in Verona, where the young American Sophia (Amanda Seyfried) and her lover come to rest. Soon she discovers a group of volunteers who respond to letters from girls allegedly addressed to Juliet, Sofia finds a letter from a woman who lost her lover back in the 60s and decides to find and reunite her loved ones.   

## "Green Book"

Departing from the theme of romance, we suggest switching to friendships. "The Green Book" is a story about a simple Italian guy Tony Vallelong, who is hired as a driver during a tour in the south of the United States by one of the best pianists in the world - African-American Don Shirley. During his trip, Vallelong uses the "Green Book", which contains information about safe places for black people. In addition, the film addresses the issue of social inequality and LGBT communities. Despite the serious themes, the story is easily perceived thanks to the sparkling jokes of the protagonists.
